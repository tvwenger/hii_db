can be associated with the same Catalog source.

==================
Distances_Reid2019
==================
Kinematic distances generated using the Wenger+2018 Monte Carlo
method and the Reid+2019 Galactic rotation model. Distances are
derived for all WISE Catalog sources with associated single-component
spectra, using the WISE Catalog position and the median VLSR and
e_VLSR of all detections associated with that source.

           :: the modes (most likely values) for the Galactocentric
	      radius, Galactocentric radius of the tangent point,

	      Bayesian credible interval (i.e., the uncertainty)

distance_kde :: the kernel density estimator for the full kinematic
	        distance probability density (i.e. without breaking
		the near/far degeneracy). For objects near the
		tangent point, this KDE defines the real kinematic
		distance uncertainty.

Examples
========
TVW recommends using a software called "sqlitebrowser" to interact
with the database. You can execute SQL queries and save the output
to formatted text files. Or you can directly interact with the
database via the python package "sqlite3".

Example 1. Get the names and positions of all "known" Catalog sources

SELECT gname, glong, glat FROM Catalog WHERE catalog = "K"

>>> Result: 2376 rows returned in 40ms

Example 2. Get the position and LSR velocities of all Catalog sources
  with an associated detection. We pick only the detection with the
  smallest fractional uncertainty in the line brightness.

SELECT cat.gname, cat.glong, cat.glat, det.vlsr, det.e_vlsr
  FROM Catalog cat
  INNER JOIN CatalogDetections catdet ON catdet.catalog_id = cat.id
  INNER JOIN Detections det ON catdet.detection_id = det.id
  WHERE det.vlsr IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY cat.gname HAVING MIN(det.e_line/det.line)

>>>Result: 2240 rows returned in 207ms

Example 3. Same as example 2, but also get the kinematic distances if
  available.

SELECT cat.gname, cat.glong, cat.glat, det.vlsr, det.e_vlsr, dist.near, dist.far, dist.tangent
  FROM Catalog cat
  INNER JOIN CatalogDetections catdet ON catdet.catalog_id = cat.id
  INNER JOIN Detections det ON catdet.detection_id = det.id
  LEFT JOIN Distances_Reid2019 dist ON dist.catalog_id = cat.id
  WHERE det.vlsr IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY cat.gname HAVING MIN(det.e_line/det.line)

>>>Result: 2240 rows returned in 392ms

Example 4. Get all WISE Catalog sources with both a kinematic and
  a parallax distance.

SELECT cat.gname, dist.near, dist.far, dist.tangent, par.plx
  FROM Catalog cat
  INNER JOIN Distances_Reid2019 dist ON dist.catalog_id = cat.id
  INNER JOIN CatalogParallax catpar ON catpar.catalog_id = cat.id
  INNER JOIN Parallax par ON catpar.parallax_id = par.id

>>> Result: 137 rows returned in 118ms
